		<p>
			This project proposal is basically just a cloud computing station. But since I cant show that
			in a static html page. I will do what everone else is doing. Making it as an amazon listing
			page. Ok so first of all, I didn't want to do it. But I still have the svelte project that I
			can share to you. heres the link <a
				href="https://github.com/Tabi3/Maple-site"
				class="text-blue-800">https://github.com/Tabi3/Maple-site</a
			>.

			The project's name is CloudBound. It's a really good name and the website name is available,
			(its 500k). The slogan is "Data Bounded to the Cloud". The general theme of the website looks
			like a fluffy cloud. It looks proffessional and has alot of gradients. As the name and slogan
			suggests, It's a cloud computing service, if I was good at coding, I can make it like firebase
			which is used in alot of websites for handling data and stuff. Or like Wolfram Alpha which is
			a calculator for equations (It's too darn powerful). This website can also store files like
			google drive, though since it is a static html page I this proposal, it won't work. Another
			thing I want it to do is reskin Khub but that's already handled by maple which I will gladly
			yoink.

			The Wireframe I made for this website is actually the website itself but in photo form. Just
			wanna say that now. However the reason i told you that is because one is a home page and the
			other is just a Hub for the outputs which looks exactly or just slightly different from the
			Hub. It will contain one page that looks like a Listing finder, The Listing itself, A
			calculator (That doesn't work), and a dummy Khub page.
